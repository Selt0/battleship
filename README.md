**Battleship**

Play battleship in ruby!

I followed along the tutorial from [App Academy](https://open.appacademy.io/)'s free online course

Play the game by running the file

```ruby
ruby lib/play_battleship.rb
```

The game is dynamic and can be played with any size grid.

| Marks | Definition |
| ----- | ---------- |
| :H    | Hit!       |
| :X    | Miss!      |
| :S    | Ship       |
| :N    | Water      |

I've learned it is very helpful to create a rspec file that outlines the project and sets the expected outputs of every method/class
